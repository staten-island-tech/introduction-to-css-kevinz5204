        But we’ve met before. That was a long time ago, I was a kid at St.
        Swithin’s, It used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. It’s an
        orphanage. My mum died when I was small, it was a car accident. I don’t
        remember it. My dad got shot a couple of years later for a gambling
        debt. Oh I remember that one just fine. Not a lot of people know what it
        feels like to be angry in your bones. I mean they understand. The
        fosters parents. Everybody understands, for a while. Then they want the
        angry little kid to do something he knows he can’t do, move on. After a
        while they stop understanding. They send the angry kid to a boy’s home,
        I figured it out too late. Yeah I learned to hide the anger, and
        practice smiling in the mirror. It’s like putting on a mask. So you
        showed up this one day, in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm. We were
        so excited! Bruce Wayne, a billionaire orphan? We used to make up
        stories about you man, legends and you know with the other kids, that’s
        all it was, just stories, but right when I saw you, I knew who you
        really were. I’d seen that look on your face before. It’s the same one I
        taught myself. I don’t why you took the fault for Dent’s murder but I’m
        still a believer in the Batman. Even if you’re not…
